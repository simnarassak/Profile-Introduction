### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Simna 
I am a Data Scientist and I hold a Master in Computer Science and Masters in Analytics (AUT, New Zealand). I love problem solving. I have always been a curious girl, that lead me to dig deep into data to find patterns and new knowledge hidden in them. After completing my second masters, I am currently working towards pursuing PhD (because its one among the many goals that I love to achieve). I love to use data to solve every day problems in our society. I have experience in machine learning, supervised and unsupervised algorithms and use data visualization techniques to present the results. I use Python, R, SQL, NoSQL and Tableau for my projects.
