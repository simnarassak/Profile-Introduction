           Data Scientist and Ph.D. student currently engaged in thesis writing and project completion. I'm passionate about leveraging multi-source data, including soil sensors, satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel-2), and time series modeling and analysis to address real-world challenges. My projects include:</p> <br/>
           [^a]           Developing a daily avocado yield forecasting framework (DAY) using TFT and RNN.<br/>
           - Analyzing the impact of riparian planting on lake water quality through soil moisture sensor data. Developing a soil moisture prediction model utilizing soil sensor data, NASA SMAP,GLDAS and ERA5 satellite data, NIWA weather data and local weather sensor data. <br/>
           - Currently, I'm researching the complex interplay between climate change and human health, particularly infectious diseases, as part of a larger digital twin project. This research involves analyzing extensive datasets, including climate change models data [CMIP5 and CMIP6] (daily data from 2000-2099), weather data, disease surveillance (2000-2024), and population data, to understand the causal relationships and potential impacts<br/>
