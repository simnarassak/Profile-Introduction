           Data Scientist and Ph.D. student currently focusing on my thesis writing and completing the research work. I'm passionate about leveraging multi-source data, including soil sensors, satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel-2), and time series analysis to address real-world challenges. My projects include developing a daily avocado yield forecasting framework (DAY) using TFT and RNN, and analyzing the impact of riparian planting on lake water quality through soil moisture sensor data. Currently researching the complex interplay between climate change and human health, particularly infectious diseases, as part of a larger digital twin project. I am using large data set like climate change models data (daily data from 2000-2099), weather data, disease surveillance (2000-2024), and population data etc.<br/>
