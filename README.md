           Data Scientist and Ph.D. student currently focusing on my thesis research. I'm passionate about leveraging multi-source data, including soil sensors, satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel-2), and time series analysis to address real-world challenges. My projects include developing a daily avocado yield forecasting framework (DAY) using TFT and RNN, and analyzing the impact of riparian planting on lake water quality through soil moisture sensor data. I'm currently investigating the influence of climate change on human health, particularly infectious diseases, using climate models, weather data, disease surveillance, and population data.<br/>
